 ### Product Management System in PHP with MySQL Database

This PHP script provides a simple product management system that allows users to create, read, update, and delete product records in a MySQL database. The script includes the following key components:

**1. Database Connection:**
   - The script includes the `db.php` file, which establishes a connection to the MySQL database.
   - The `$db` object is created to handle database operations.

**2. Create Product:**
   - The `check()` function checks if the `create` action is requested through the POST method.
   - If `create` is requested, the script collects the following product details from the POST data:
     - `title`
     - `price`
     - `sku`
     - `product_code`
     - `discription`
   - An INSERT query is constructed to add the new product to the `product` table.
   - The `insert()` method of the `$db` object is used to execute the INSERT query and redirect the user to the `all-product.php` page.

**3. Delete Product:**
   - If a `pid` (product ID) is specified in the GET request, the script attempts to delete the product with that ID.
   - The `delete()` method of the `$db` object is used to execute the DELETE query and redirect the user to the `all-product.php` page.

**4. Update Product:**
   - If the `update` action is requested through the POST method, the script collects the updated product details from the POST data.
   - The `pid` (product ID) is also collected from the POST data to identify the product to be updated.
   - An UPDATE query is constructed to update the product record in the `product` table.
   - The `update()` method of the `$db` object is used to execute the UPDATE query and redirect the user to the `all-product.php` page.

**5. Code Snippets:**
   - **Database Connection:**
     ```php
     include_once '../controller/db.php';
     $db=new db();
     ```

   - **Create Product:**
     ```php
     if ($check) {
         $title = $_POST['title'];
         $price = $_POST['price'];
         $sku = $_POST
